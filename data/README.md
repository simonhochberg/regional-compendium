I was unable to load the county-level County Business Patterns data to Github because it is too large.

The 2013 data can be found <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2013/econ/cbp/2013-cbp.html">here</a>, and the 2016 data can be found <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2016/econ/cbp/2016-cbp.html">here</a>.
